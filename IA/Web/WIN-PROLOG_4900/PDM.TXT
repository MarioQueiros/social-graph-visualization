========================

Welcome to the Portable Dialog Manager (PDM) for Windows! 

Loading The Portable Dialog Manager
-----------------------------------
To load the portable dialog manager, you first need to run the WIN-PROLOG
application. Once this is running you can then enter the following command
at the WIN-PROLOG command line:

        ?- ensure_loaded(system(pdc)).


Changes for Prolog version 4.04
-------------------------------

The PDM picture functions have been brought into line with the new graphics
system, this means that all objects like brushes, pens, icons and bitmaps,
should be loaded before use in a PDM statement. The style of the graphics has
also changed, please see the documentation for the predicate gfx/1 to see what
sort of things are now valid. In particular please note that where before a
picture took a list as its value it is now a structure, for example:

   [ brsh(0,0,0,0), rect(0,0,100,100) ... ]

becomes

   ( brush = stock(black_brush) -> rectangle(0,0,100,100) ... ) 

etc.

as per the new graphics.
