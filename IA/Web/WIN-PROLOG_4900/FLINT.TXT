WIN-PROLOG Version 4.900
========================

Welcome to the FLINT fuzzy logic toolkit.

Running FLINT from WIN-PROLOG
-----------------------------
To run FLINT from WIN-PROLOG you should first load WIN-PROLOG and then enter 
the following command at the Prolog command line:

	?- ensure_loaded(system(flint)).

This command will enable you to load and run the fuzzy examples provided with
the FLINT toolkit disk.

Using the fuzzy editor
----------------------
Before the fuzzy editor can be used it must be loaded by the following 
command:

       ?- ensure_loaded(system(fuzzed)).
       
This places a menu option on the "run" menu. Please note that this menu item
is only enabled when a prolog source code window is in focus, or if you are
using flex a flex source code window.   

The Fuzzy Logic Examples
------------------------
There are two sets of examples provided, examples with a '.PL' extension 
intended for use with the Prolog, and examples with a '.KSL' extension intended
for use with the flex expert system environment. Once you have started the 
appropriate environment you can then load your chosen example using the 
predicate ensure_loaded/1.

The following command loads the fuzzy Prolog example TURBINE.PL:

        ?- ensure_loaded( examples(turbine) ).

The following command loads the fuzzy flex example TURBINE.KSL:

	?- ensure_loaded( examples( 'turbine.ksl' ) ).
