<h2>Simple Fuzzy Car Evaluation Program</h2>

<pre>
Using the age, engine capacity, cost, efficiency (in terms of Miles
Per Gallon) top speed and capacity of a car, this program calculates
an overall rating of how suitable the car is for purchasing.

A fuzzy variable is defined for each of the car qualities.
A matrix of fuzzy rules is then given for each fuzzy variable, which
relates the fuzzy_sets of the fuzzy variables to a suitability value.

The program calculate_car_suitability/1 takes the raw data for each
car and puts this through the fuzzy program to generate the cars
suitability value. The final result is returned as a list containing
the name of each car and its score sorted so that the best car is at
the front of the list.
