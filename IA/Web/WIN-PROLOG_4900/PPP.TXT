WIN-PROLOG Version 4.900
========================

Welcome to Prolog++ for WIN-PROLOG!

To load prolog++:

?- ensure_loaded( system(pppenv) ).

This will load the Prolog++ environment and the Prolog++ runtime engine.

Please note that if you force the re-loading of pppenv - through
for example load_files/1 - then the second and subsequent loads will throw
an error. This is caused by environment settings being overwritten on
subsequent loads.  The only recourse in that event is to quit prolog and start
again, otherwise unspecified behaviour may occur. The correct way of loading
the Prolog++ environment is either through a shorcut or the console command line:

?- ensure_loaded( system(pppenv) ).

Shortcuts are created at install time that will run Prolog++.

The example programs are now in the sub-directory EXAMPLES\PPP .
