WIN-PROLOG Version 4.900
========================

Welcome to flex for WIN-PROLOG 4.900.

flex comes as three files FLEXENV.PC, FLEXDLG.PC and FLEX.PC. To load flex 
at the command line type:

?- ensure_loaded( system(flexenv) ). 

This will load the flex environment and the flex runtime library.

Please note that if you force the re-loading of flexenv - through
for example load_files/1 - then the second and subsequent loads will throw
an error. This is caused by environment settings being overwritten on 
subsequent loads.  The only recourse in that event is to quit prolog and start
again, otherwise unspecified behaviour may occur. The correct way of loading 
the flex environment is either through a shorcut or the console command line:

?- ensure_loaded( system(flexenv) ). 

You can load the flex dialogs and runtime without the environment by:

?- ensure_loaded( system(flexdlg) ).

Shortcuts are created at install time that will run flex.

The example programs are now in the subdirectory examples\flex .

For an application the flexenv file is not required, but flex and flexdlg are.
