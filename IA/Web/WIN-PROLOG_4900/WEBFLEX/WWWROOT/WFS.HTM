<H2>WebFlex</H2>

This document describes the availability of the <I>flex</I> expert system toolkit on the World Wide Web. LPA flex is an expressive and flexible AI toolkit, and provides a comprehensive and versatile set of facilities for programmers to construct sophisticated, readable and portable expert systems.<P>

<H3>Staightforward Delivery</H3>

WebFlex allows you to deliver your flex-based expert systems onto Intranets and Extranets easily. Just create your rules and frames and questions as per normal in flex, and WebFlex will construct a web server-based solution using ProWeb where all the questions are sent automatically configured for a standard HTML/Javascript browser.<P>

<H3>Extendability</H3>

If, however, you want to include your own bespoke HTML, GIF, page layout instructions, then you can include these too with minimal additional work. This way you can develop rule-based diagnostic systems, decision-support aids, etc and have them adhere to your own house-style for web-based applications.<P>

<H3>Ease of Use</H3>

So now you can build intelligent web sites using a high-level rule language and not have to get your hands dirty. Why not test drive this now?<P>
