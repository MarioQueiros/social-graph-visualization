The files supplied in this directory are to demonstrate the use of 
the edinbrugh libraries. Because all of these files use the edinbrugh
libraries you must ensure that you assert a file_search_path for the 
public directory.

ie assert(file_search_path(public,prolog(public))).

The demos perform the following tasks;

queens.pl:	solves the N-queen problem
crypta.pl:	solves cryptarithmetic puzzles
bfs.pl:		breath-first solution to the Missionaries and Cannibals
dfs.pl:		depth-first solution to the Missionaries and Cannibals
heu.pl:		heuristic solution to the Missionaries and Cannibals

for a more detailed explanation, please look at the files themsevels.


Have fun
