<H2>Bayesian Belief Network Example</H2>
This example demonstrates the use of forward-chaining uncertainty rules in a motor insurance fraud detection problem.<p>
<h3>Description</h3>

The example implements a probablistic fraud detection expert system.<p>
The problem is tackled in four distinct stages:

<ol>
  <li>Initialise fraud indicators to their a priori probabilities.</li>
  <li>Ask the user for indicator probabilities, either from a list of yes, no and not_known or by means of a number between 0 (false) and 1 (true).</li>
  <li>Calculate the overall probability of fraud using Bayesian updating.</li>
  <li>Carry out hypothetical reasoning to see what unknown indicators would be worth investigating (if any).</li>
</ol>
